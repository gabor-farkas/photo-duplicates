# Remove Google Photos duplicates
It's a long story but it happened to me that I moved some of my photo folders and they were re-uploaded by Google Photos, resulting in many photos being duplicated. On my local machine I had a downsized version of many of my photos, so I clearly wanted to keep only the higher resolution (original) ones on Google Photos.

## The quest
No worries, I'm a developer, I can fix this. Google Photos even has an API! Well, I was mistaken just like some PMs and CEOs do: though it indeed has an API, it's functionality is very limited - you cannot actually change anything.
